                <h2>Sturm und Drang movement</h2>
                <p>
                    'A literay and artisitc movement in Germany in the late eighteenth 
                    century by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and characterized by the expression 
                    of emotion unrest and a rejection of neoclassical literacy norms.'
                    <a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> This movement lays the foundation of the 
                    later Romanticism. Its concepts include 'no more classicla rules and 
                    proportion, no more mimesis - now it was<span id="dots">...</span>
                    <span id="more">

                    individual artist and his own 
                    special experience and emotions which were to take centre-stage. It was 
                    now the individual's originality, spontaneity, authenticity, and sincerity 
                    which were at a premium.'<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> The idea of 'We 
                    live in a world we ourselves create.'<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a> Spread 
                    out in the Germany society thoroughly, so that's why the desire from the 
                    citizen of attending to concerts in concert hall was so strong during the 
                    late eightenth century and the early nineteenth century, because they think 
                    listening to concerts were no longer the entertainment only for nobility, we 
                    ordinary people should also have the right to attend to concerts.

                 <h2>The development of orchestral works in the late classical period</h2>
                 <p>
                    The expansion of orchestra in history started since Haydn's musical trip 
                to London in 1791-2, the venue of his Solomom concerts in London can hold
                at least 800 seats, and the room size is much bigger than the concert hall 
                in the Esterhazy palace of Eisenstadt where Haydn wrote many symphonies for 
                and experimented symphonic form. London at that time in the eighteenth century
                had many concert organizations, and concert activies were active.
                <a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> During his 
                service to Prince Esterhazy, he was writing symphonies for 14 players in which 
                3 violins for first and second violins, 1 viola, 1 cello, 1 double bass, 1 bassoon, 
                2 oboes and 2 horns. But in his symphonies for his concerts in London, he was given 
                a condition that allowed him to write symphonies for between 50 to 60 players.

                 <h2>Concert hall in Leipzig</h2>
             <p>
                Underlying the factors of the rise of individualism in German society and the 
                influence from concert life in London, the idea of building large public concert 
                halls in Leipzig in Germany was desperate as Leipzig has always been the major 
                musical city in Germany where the famous St. Thomas's Boys Choir have belonged to 
                that J. S. Bach was the most famous choirmaster, <a href="#footnote-12">[12]</a> and 
                the foremost German-language musical periodial the <em>Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung</em>
                was published in Leipzig started in the late eighteenth century.<a href="#footnote-13">[13]</a> 
                As aresult, Gewandhaus the concert hall was built, and it has its own Gewandhaus concert series 
                of Leipzig since it was built in 1781 and the tradition still goes on today.

                <h2>Summary of the social changes related to the development of Gewandhaus the concert hall in Leipzig</h2>
                <p>
                    Social climax in the nineteenth century allowed ordinary people also can listen to music as 
                    freely as the nobility. Consequently, the need of building big halls increased due to the increasing 
                    numbers of audience. Gewandhaus the concert hall was completed renovation and opened in 1781. It is one of 
                    the earliest Concert Halls in western music history in terms of its large size and the number of seats. Sturm 
                    und Drang movement provokes the idea of national unity and individualism, and it lays a foundation of the later 
                    Romanticism. Orchestral music developed by Joseph Haydn that increased in orchestral player number. Leipzig as a 
                    traditional musical town was unavoidably been musically developed, and resulted the building of the famous Gewandhaus 
                    as it is one of the earliest large in size concert hall for public.
