                Felix Mendelssohn was appointed as the Music Director in Gewandhaus orchestra 
                for two period of time (1835-1843), (1845-1847). He died in his Leipzig home in 1847.

                <h2>He trained up and enlarged his Gewandhaus Orchestra</h2>
                <p>
                    Under the influence in the social aspect and in the music developmennt aspect, it 
                    is not hard to predict the development of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, and indeed, it 
                    had a change on its orchestral player number. In the orchestral player numbers comparison 
                    table (Fig.1)<a href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>, just before Mendelssohn became th music 
                    Director in 1833, there were 34 members in the orchestra, and the number of members increased 
                    to 47 by the time of 1839 with more violins, cellos, double basses and Timpani.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the directorship of Mendelssohn, the orchestra was no longer rely on the concertmaster for 
                    beating time, interestingly, at that time, 'the concertmaster sometimes beating times, sometimes 
                    playing, directed instrumental works from his desk.' (Friedrich Schmidt who is an architect 
                    commented on Mendelssohn's conducting style) Then the music director 
                    would take over time beating 
                    when the singing ocurred.

                    Besides the leadership on time beating, Mendelssohn <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                    also set out some rules in his conducting practice 
                    such as, strict discipline, careful rehearsing, baton conducting.<a href="#footnote-16">[16]</a> And he 
                    designed a player seating model for his orchestra that suggest the basic of inner-aural image when he 
                    thinks in orchestral forces.<a href="#footnote-17">[17]</a> The seating model is shown in Fig. 2 
                    <a href="#footnote-18">[18]</a> Ferdinand David, the concertmaster in Mendelssohn's orchestra highly 
                    appreciated on his model, he says' The orchestral arrangment in this admirable hall is so good, 
                    communication between the conductor and each member of the orchestra is so easy, the players... have
                     been trained by Mendelssohn to such a poutch of disciplice and concertration that two rehearsal suffuced 
                     for putting together a long programme.<a href="#footnote-19">[19]</a></span>

                <h2>His motivation on reviving historical compositions</h2>
                <p>
                    Mendelssohn rasied historical awareness to his orchestra, he demanded his orchestra for the need of a 
                    'prodominantly non-vibrate tone.'He states that 'the orchestral violinist should "avoid every addition 
                    of turns, doubleturns, shakes or'likewise all artificial shifting.'<a href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>(Dacid Milsom, 2008)

                <h2>Mendelssohn's audience</h2>
                <p>
                    During 1815-1850, Leipzig grew from 45,000 to 63,000, and up to 2010 population in Leipzig was increased to 522,883. 
                    <a href="#footnote-22">[22]</a> So proprtionately, the audience for concert was higher in the nineteenth century. 
                    <a href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>Mendelssohn's educational desire of promting histocial repertoire characterized by his
                     Bourgeois audience, 'The Englightment and the early nineteenth century produced diverse viewpoints on education, 
                     which framed the bourgeois educational experience.'<a href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1824) 
                     commented 'The role of rising education in creating national cultural unity.'<a href="#footnote-25">[25]</a> So, under 
                     the social climax in rising nationality unity and significance of education, that created a solid ground of Mendelssohn's 
                     audience. Fig.4 <a href="#footnote-26">[26]</a> is an example of programme on the Revival Performance in 1829 in Berlin. 
                     From the programme, it shows Mendelssohn's audience was varied. And from that, it gives a clearer idea what types of audience
                     he had while he was in Leipzig.
