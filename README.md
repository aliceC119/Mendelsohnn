My personal exploration website is a site for anyone interested in musical research topics. The site provides information for anyone who is curious about the relationshp between the famous composer and conductor Felix Mendelssohn and one of the most important concert halls in Europe. The information and sources are based on one of my reseach projects during my master study in 2012.
